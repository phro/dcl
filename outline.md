# Computational and Mathematical Linguistics Project #

Participants: Jesse Frohlich and Andrew Wilson

## Ideas ## 

- Build a syntax parser for the constructed language toki pona. Given a
  sentence in toki pona, check for
  - grammaticality (i.e. whether a valid syntax tree exists)
  - ambiguity (i.e. whether multiple such trees exist)

- Find other languages which can be easily parsed
  - Esperanto
  - Ithkuil
  - Lojban

- Syntactic ambiguity
  - Which combinations of syntactic features result in a large number of
    possible syntax trees? I.e. which languages allow for the most syntactic
    puns (as opposed to morphological puns).

- \*Density questions.
  - Can you distinguish poetry from prose from nonesense by analyzing
    compressibility of a passage of text?

## Languages ##
- Haskell (functional, pretty)
- Python (easy-to-code, good for prototyping)
- Other
  - Rust (functional and procedural, safe)
  - Ruby (OOL)
  - Go
